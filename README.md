# Abl_kinase_N368S

This is a project exploring the DFG flip in human Abl1 kinase, both in wild type and a resistance mutation N368S, with and without the cognate small-molecule ligand for each structure ([2HYY](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/2hyy) and [2GQG](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/2gqg)). The enhanced sampling scheme used is Self-adjusted Mixture Sampling ([SAMS](https://github.com/choderalab/sams)). The manuscript associated with this project is in press.

## Manifest

* `SAMS_simulations/` - scripts and input files needed to perform SAMS simulations to different protein complexes
* `data_analysis/` - scripts for quantitative analysis of the simulation trajectories to depicture different hydrogen bonding patterns in wild type and the mutant, before and after the DFG flip
* `structures/` - initial structures of different protein (complexes) we used for simulation
